# User-Driven Incident Urgency Classification Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering workflow where
user-provided incident details are processed, classified for urgency using
business rules, and stored in PostgreSQL for analysis and reporting.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- TablePlus
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
1. User inputs incident details
2. Business rules classify incident urgency
3. Data is transformed and encoded
4. Records are stored in PostgreSQL
5. Data integrity enforced using primary key constraints
6. SQL validation performed using TablePlus

## Key Features
- Interactive user-driven data ingestion
- Rule-based urgency classification
- PostgreSQL integration
- Duplicate prevention using primary keys
- Clean, documented Jupyter workflow

## How to Run
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. Create database `incident_db`
3. Open the Jupyter notebook
4. Run cells top to bottom
5. Enter incident details when prompted
